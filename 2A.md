David Freedman makes three objections against Pollan. First, he points out that supporters of Pollan have a fundamental yet untenable assumption that processed foods are inherently wrong. Second, people of the largest group suffered from the “obesity epidemic”, namely the poor class, cannot and are unwilling to switch to organic foods as proposed by Pollanites. Last, Freedman gives a rigid analysis on why the food industry is capable of making our diets healthier in a significant way.

Freedman describes the wholesome-food movement as something “awfully close to religion.” He claims that there lacks “hard evidence to back any health-risk claims about processed food.” It is noteworthy that by “health” Freedman means issues related with obese. As he repeats in his article, the “obesity epidemic” is such a serious issue that Americans may experience a decrease of ten years in life expectation in our generation. Pollan does give an account of why feedlot-based meat production might be bad for our health: cows are not adapted to corns and are infected with bacteria when they are slaughtered; the abuse of antibody may create bacteria that cannot be cured; feeding cows with meats may cause mad cow disease again (Pollan 65 – 84). Yet when the topic is restricted with obesity, it seems that the lack of hard evidence is present, which makes Freedman’s argument compelling. While some supporters of organic food may say that fast foods are inherently more likely to be over consumed, Freedman would respond by his following account on how the food industry can—and is the only party that can—resolve the issue.

The next thing Freedman discusses is who, among the millions of American citizens, are suffering from obesity most. Freedman points out that there is a clear class division in this issue: the relatively poor majority of Americans are those who are more likely to be overweight. The consequence of such a division, however, is that it is unlikely for these people to eat organic foods. Organic foods are more expensive and less tasty. There are also less convenient. As I pointed out in my previous paper, sometimes one needs to make a compromise between perfection and the reality. In this case, acknowledging that those who need healthy foods are those who are most unlikely to consume organic foods. Since it is impractical to change the diet habit of these people, what Pollanites are advocating becomes essentially useless. Unfortunately, Pollan does not give any counterargument over this issue. Quite the contrary, Pollan and his allies efforts in publicizing their ideology confirms this issue.

Lastly, Freedman gives several examples to show that the food industry can indeed make our diet healthier and they are indeed going this direction. The main opposition lies in how to reduces fat and sugar without disturbing the eating experience. Freedman says that modern food process technology could circumvent this issue in such a degree that it can help most overweight people to achieve weight loss. Since Freedman has argued that it is unreasonable to blame processed food only because they are processed, this point is persuasive. Then, Freedman handles the counterargument that why, if the food industry is working on this issue, they do not advertise the health benefit of their products. The answer is, according to Freedman, that consumers when heard of healthy foods will think these foods are less tasty than their normal counterparts. At last, Freedman explains the potential motivations behind the industry’s move of making their products healthier. Pollan seems to automatically assume that the industry is evil, and offers little counter-evidence.

Overall, Freedman’s argument is compelling.
