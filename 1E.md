# Industrial Agriculture is More Sustainable

Are technology advancement and industrialization in the agriculture sector beneficial? Some people have a negative answer towards this question. In his book _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_, Pollan discusses the dark side of the highly industrialized agriculture in today’s America. In particular, modern agriculture, according to Pollan, is a primary culprit of environment pollution. However, there are two issues Pollan and other supporters of the unindustrialized organic agriculture fail to see. First, people eat far more meats than they did half an century ago, and it requires an insane amount of plants to grow so much meats, which Pollan’s “beyond organic” agriculture cannot deliver. Second, from an economic perspective, large-scale production is inherently more efficient. By transferring the role of farming from traditional farmers to highly trained experts in food factories, it is much easier to control pollution and reduce energy waste—plus necessary governmental supervision is guaranteed. Therefore, the issues of industrialized agriculture presented in Pollan’s book is solvable and Pollan’s proposal has an insuperable problem, which leads to my claim that it is industrial agriculture that really is the future of sustainable food production.

Pollan points out that the industrial food system—especially the conventional agriculture—is wasteful, but he fails to evaluate this issue comprehensively.
In _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_, Pollan criticizes the industrial food system for its burden on our environment. In particular, Pollan talks about how farmers abuse chemical fertilizers and the environment crisis brought by excess nitrogen (Pollan 46 – 47). However, such pollution is caused by untrained farmers rather than the synthetic fertilizer _per se_. If farmers scientifically measure the nitrogen needed, they can use the exact amount of fertilizer required so that not only the fertilizer is saved—hence saving the petroleum to produce synthesize fertilizer (Pollan 45)—but there will also be no pollution caused by the excess nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, as Paarlberg mentions, such high-tech farming has already become actual in rich countries for many years (Paarlberg 245). On the other hand, small-scale organic has its own issue. As pointed out by Biello, a supporter of organic food, farmers need to learn the knowledge of maintaining an entire ecosystem, while in conventional agriculture, all parameters farmers need to know are merely “synthetic fertilizer, chemical pesticides, and the like” (Biello 233). Average American farmers clearly do not have such expertise, otherwise there will be no abuse of fertilizers in the first place. Besides, even if Pollan and his friends successfully persuade the American government to enforce every farmer to receive education on organic farming techniques, farmers in the most countries on this planet—poor African and Asian countries in particular—can never receive such advanced education. The only feasible solution is to adopt the industrial agriculture and let highly trained experts to grow food. Using high-tech sustainable conventional agriculture whenever possible, and when the marginal gain of the organic agriculture is required, using _industrial_ organic agriculture. For developing countries, foreign direct investment in the agriculture sector can solve their food crisis.

Beyond the production itself, Pollan also blames the modern food procession system. Though emotionally understandable, such criticism makes no sense after one thinks about it rationally. In his description of Earthbound Farm, a company that provides ready to eat organic salad, Pollan mentions that it takes “57 calories of fossil fuel energy for every calorie of food”, a figure only four percent lower than conventionally grown salad (Pollan 167). However, such a number cannot be used to justify Pollan’s “beyond organic” dream. In his interview of Salatin, a farmer from the green Polyface Farm, the latter mentioned that they refused to ship foods because they were “really serious about energy”. Customers have to “drive down here to Swoope to pick it up” (Pollan 133). Obviously, it spends more energy than delivering a truck of foods to a market than asking each one to drive to the farm to pick a small amount of amount. Alternatively, if this “beyond organic” paradigm becomes the dominant way to provide food in United States, such “waste” of energy is unavoidable. Some may argue that maybe it is the modern lifestyle we should give up. Instead of eating processed foods, one should cook by themselves or even grow the food by themselves. However, such a view neglects the time cost imposed on every member of our society. Human beings choose to reduce their time spent on eating foods because in this way they can be happier and create more value. People are interested in saving energy because they want to protect the environment, which in turn makes people happier. If protecting the environment seriously impedes our happiness yet choosing not to do it has no direct impact on our life, no one will care the environment. Since it is inevitable to spend a significant amount of energy in processing and storing foods, the only thing left consider is to choose a way that minimizes the energy consumption. Due to the efficiency brought by the large-scale production, industrial food system has a significant advantage over its old-fashioned competitor. For example, Earthbound developed their own lettuce-shaving machine (Pollan 166), but one cannot expect a traditional farmer to develop its own machine. Besides, such a machine might be so expensive that unless multiple small farms share one machine the cost will not be worth the investment. The efficiency in large-scale production was what enabled the prosperous industrial revolution, there is no reason to believe that the same factor will fail the food sector.

Last but not least, the “beyond organic” farming practice Pollan boasts simply cannot feed the population. It is a fact that nowadays meat such as beef and chicken has become a major constituent of an American’s daily meal. In its nutritional guidelines, USDA also recommends the intake of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs (USDA 113). The world needs so much meat. However, animals are extremely inefficient in converting energy stored in plants to energy stored in proteins. To grow to be slaughtered, a steer has to consume “the equivalent thirty-five gallons of oil” (Pollan 84). While Pollan think Americans grow too many corns (Pollan 61 – 64), which reduces the biodiversity (Pollan 38 – 40), the reality is that without those corns there will not be enough meat to eat. Paarlberg also mentions that if Europe decides to use organic method to grow livestocks, “an additional 28 million hectares of cropland” are required, which might lead to mass deforestation (Paarlberg 245). Moreover, it is unreasonable to ask people to stay away from meat—some might follow and become vegetarian, but the majority people simply do not care. Hence, it is clear that even though “beyond organic” might be able to feed a margin of our population who pay much attention to their diets, an industrial food system is indispensable to keep our society to work.

Overall, issues of the food industry can be surmounted and the idea of organic agriculture by small farms cannot feed enough people. Indeed, our lifestyle cause a huge amount of food waste, but that is a price people from a modern society choose to pay. If someone is interested in protecting our environment and caring our food health, he or she should probably work hard to push legislation, to resolve issues such as the unfair economic distribution between farmers and the food industry, and to remind people of the potential danger behind the abuse of antibiotic. However, the industrialization of food production _per se_ is not a bad thing. One should never fear something simply because it is unnatural, for our very existence relies on changing the nature.
