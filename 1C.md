People should care the fact that we are corn eaters because it has severe negative impacts on our world. According to Pollan, industrial food production is not sustainable and creates pollution that people could have avoided, though the validity of such claim was questioned by Hurst (Hurst 210). Pollen also pointed out that there are several safety issues with industrial foods, which I have discussed in 1B and omitted here.

Despite these two “utilitarian” issues with America’s corn industry, Pollan also discussed two moral issues. The first one is about the distribution of economic gain between family farmers and big corporations. Farmers sell corns at a price lower than the cost of growing their corns (Pollan 53). The government subsidies corn farms to make the system sustainable (Pollan 61), but essentially taxpayers’ money went into big corporations’ pockets (Pollan 63). Clearly, Pollan did not like the status quo and thought that those big corporations did not *deserve* the money. In other worlds, he thought the food production sector was unfair to its labors. Another issue is regarding the life standards of industrially grown animals, in particular cattle fed in feedlots (Pollan 79 – 80).

To many people, organic foods are the opposite of what I described above. As Pollan put, organic farms should use “a softer, more harmonious approach” (Pollan 143). Pollan also compared the underlying principle between the organic approach and the conventional one (Pollan 146 – 151). In short, while the conventional method relies on “reductionist science” (Pollan 150), the organic method leverages what the nature bestows on us. Clearly, people chose the conventional agriculture for its high immediate yields.

Nevertheless, the return of the organic agriculture is not what people usually imagined. For instance, organic animals must have “access to pasture” (Pollan 157), but in practice such access is purely symbolic (Pollan 172). Taking a more comprehensive view of the lifecycle of an organic food product, one could find that it is not that environmentally friendly compared with its “conventional” counterpart. For every calorie of organic salad, “57 calories of fossil fuel energy” is consumed during the food storage, transport, and process. This is only 4 percent lower than conventionally grown salad (Pollan 167). It seemed that Pollan was angry about these big organic food companies because they tricked customers into thinking that these corporations products are superior but the reality is the exact opposite. In other words, he thought such business practice was immoral.

Hurst objected Pollan’s viewpoints by directly commenting on the latter’s book. For instance, Hurst pointed out that chemical fertilizers are necessary, since it is impractical to gain an equivalent amount of nitrogen in an organic way (Hurst 210 – 211). While what he said might be true from a farmer’s perspective, I do not think his view is incompatible with that of Pollan. Pollan pointed out that America do not need such a huge amount of corns (Pollan 62), and by reducing the amount of corns required to grow, it might be possible to achieve the goal of feeding everyone with a transition to organic agriculture. David Biello discussed this issue in-depth in his article _Will Organic Food Fail to Feed the World?_, and the result is in favor of organic food (Biello 233 – 234).

Paarlberg had a stance similar to Hurst. This time, however, he discussed the food production outside United States. He pointed to that Africa is still suffering hunger (Paarlberg 241), and one very important reason is that Africans use almost no fertilizers (Paarlberg 246). Nevertheless, what he presented is not persuasive enough when one considers data provided by Biello. Another very interesting point is that it is technically impossible to feed animals with the organic approach, which means that sometimes we have to make the compromise (Paarlberg 244 – 245). But if one can grow corns using the conventional method *without* polluting the environment, it does not sound that bad to me.
