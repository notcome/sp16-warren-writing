# Industrial Agriculture is Sustainable
Is industrialization in the agriculture sector beneficial? Some people have a negative answer towards this question. In his book _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_, Pollan discusses the dark side of the highly industrialized agriculture in today’s America. In particular, modern agriculture, according to Pollan, is a primary culprit of environment pollution. He proposes that we should switch to beyond organic, which requires farmers to maintain a delicate ecological balance so that it is sustainable and pollution-free (citation required). However, there are three issues Pollan fail to consider. First, large-scale production is inherently more efficient. By transferring the role of farming from traditional farmers to highly trained experts in food factories, it is much easier to control pollution and reduce energy waste. Second, many types of waste are caused by our lavish lifestyle, yet it is impossible to relinquish this modern lifestyle. Third, Pollan and his friends fail to present convincing data to show that beyond organic can deliver enough foods. Therefore, the issues of industrialized agriculture presented in Pollan’s book is solvable and Pollan’s proposal has an insuperable problem, which leads to my claim that it is industrial agriculture that is the future of sustainable food production.

Pollan believes that beyond organic is much more friendly to our environment than its industrial counterparts, namely conventional agriculture and industrialized organic agriculture. In practice, however, such a claim does not hold for two reasons. First, modern technology can eliminate most pollution caused by industrial agriculture. For example, Pollan talks about how farmers abuse chemical fertilizers to ensure that the soil can grow enough corns. This practice has a severe negative impact on our environment: excess nitrogen will flow off and concentrate in the sea, which has created a dead zone in Gulf of Mexico (Pollan 46 – 47). Nevertheless, this kind of pollution is caused by untrained farmers rather than the synthetic fertilizer _per se_. If farmers scientifically measure the nitrogen needed, they can use the exact amount of fertilizer required and there will be no excess nitrogen to cause pollution. In fact, as Paarlberg mentions, such high-tech farming has already become actual in rich countries for many years (Paarlberg 245).

Another reason that beyond organic cannot beat its industrial counterparts is that the expertise required for beyond organic cannot be reproduced in a large scale. While in conventional agriculture all parameters farmers need to know are merely “synthetic fertilizer, chemical pesticides, and the like” (Biello 233), in organic agriculture farmers need to maintain an entire ecosystem. As Biello put in his article, organic agriculture is a “knowledge-intensive” sector (Biello 233). The success of capitalism has taught us that it is better to separate the estate—in this case, farms—from technicians, which is exactly what industrial agriculture is. After all, average American farmers are not well-educated in farming, otherwise they would not abuse synthetic fertilizers in the first place. Besides, if one considers this issue globally, it is unrealistic to educate farmers in most countries—poor African and Asian countries in particular—to go beyond organic. In contrast, it is much wiser to let international corporations to grow food efficiently. In conclusion, even when organic agriculture’s marginal benefit on environment protection is a necessity, it is more realistic to employ the industrial model of organic farming.

Beyond production, Pollan also blames the modern food procession system. This criticism, however, is also untenable. Pollan points out that to make ready-to-eat organic salad, it takes “57 calories of fossil fuel energy for every calorie of food.” A large amount of energy is “wasted” in the large refrigerator in which workers process vegetables and turn them into salad (Pollan 167). How does beyond organic perform in this area? Ironically, Pollan eschews this problem completely. In his interview of Salatin, a beyond organic farmer, the latter mentions that they refuse to ship foods because they were “really serious about energy.” Customers will have to “drive down here” to “pick it up” (Pollan133). Since there is no food process nor shipment in beyond organic, there is of course no energy wasted in this step. Yet one should take into account the energy each customer spends driving down to the farm, which is much more than that required to deliver an equivalent amount of food by a single truck to a supermarket. Beyond organic is by no means energy-friendly. Energy still is spent, albeit invisibly.

Perhaps it is our lavish lifestyle that Pollan takes as target: instead of eating highly processed foods, one should prepare their foods by raw materials and grow these materials if necessary. However, Pollan neglects the time cost imposed by such a natural lifestyle, which makes the later impractical. Compared with our immediate interests in saving more time for our life, our looming concerns over environmental problems are of no consequence. Choosing not to protect the environment has no direct impact on our life—it is fishes that are dying in the Gulf of Mexico, not _Homo sapiens_. Therefore, if saving our environment requires us to give up time, most people will not follow.

Since it is inevitable to spend energy in processing and storing foods, the only thing to consider is to choose a way that minimizes the energy consumption. Contrary to many people’s stereotypes, this is a field where our industrial agriculture can easily beat its naturalism competitor. The reason is that large-scale production, from an economic perspective, is inherently more efficient. For example, Earthbound Farm developed their own lettuce-shaving machine (Pollan 166), which could save human labor significantly.  One cannot expect a traditional farmer to develop their own machine. Moreover, such a machine might be so expensive that unless multiple small farms share one machine the cost will not be worth the investment. The example above—asking each customer to drive down to the farm versus delivering a batch of food using a single truck to a supermarket—also exemplifies this point. The efficiency in large-scale production enabled the prosperous industrial revolution. There is no reason to believe that the same factor will fail the food sector.

Last but not least, it is questionable whether beyond organic is capable of feeding people worldwide with our current demands on foods. Boasters of organic farming present evidence that we are producing more food than we need and manage to persuade us that it is food waste that should be fixed. They seem to ignore two important factors though. First, it is unclear whether it is easy to eliminate food waste in developed countries like United States. A significant portion of foods are thrown away because of our modern lifestyle. For instance, one may clear up one’s refrigerator because labels on foods say that they are expired, even though these foods are still edible (citation from the video required, ask for permission). However, as argued above, it is hard to relinquish our modern lifestyle. People do not have enough time to care whether foods marked expired in their refrigerators are edible or not. With economy consistently grows up, it is conceivable that people will become more and more lavish in consuming foods, putting even higher demands on food production.

Structural changes in our diets are also under appreciated. Nowadays, meat and other foods from animals have become major constituents of people’s daily meal. In its nutritional guidelines, USDA also recommends the intake of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs (USDA 113). This planet needs meat. However, animals are extremely inefficient in converting energy stored in plants to proteins. For example, a steer has to consume “the equivalent thirty-five gallons of oil” before it is ready for slaughter (Pollan 84). While some may think that Americans’ industrial food system grow too many corns each year (Pollan 61 – 64), the reality is that without those corns there will be a dearth of meat. Paarlberg also mentions that if Europe decides to use organic method to grow livestocks, “an additional 28 million hectares of cropland” are required (Paarlberg 245). It is unreasonable to ask everyone to stay away from meat, and as average life standard keeps improving, the demand on animal products will only increase. Hence, it is clear that supporters of the natural farming paradigm need data that are more convincing to show that beyond organic can indeed replace our well-established industrial food system without lowering our life standards significantly.

It is understandable for people to fear new technologies. Pioneers often pay high prices for their boldness, sharing the fate of those dead fishes in the Gulf of Mexico. However, industrialization in the agriculture sector has matured. The polluting image of conventional agriculture is the past. The advantages brought by large-scale production have outweighed even the most delicate natural system. Indeed, there are many issues in American agriculture—like the unfair distribution of economic gains between small farmers and large corporations (Pollan 53)—but we should move forward to push legislation to maximize the potential of industrialization rather than moving backward to surrender to the nature. The future of sustainable food production should be using high-tech sustainable conventional agriculture whenever possible, and when the marginal gain of the organic agriculture is required, using industrial organic agriculture.
