From an overarching perspective, Pollan believes what is natural is the most suitable. The reason behind such a view is simple: what is currently present is the most stable state of our complex natural system. Here I give two instances of such an idealism. First, Pollan points out that Americans should place their faith in some dietary traditions rather than the so-called “scientific evidences” (Pollan 296, 299 – 303). Two, Pollan presents a rebut for the animal rightists that prevent killing animals is not necessarily good for a species (Pollan 322 – 325).

As for the conversation of food health, only the first example I give above fits in. In Freedman’s essay, the latter argues that it is impractical to let the largest victim group—namely the poor class—to switch to a diet consisting mainly of unprocessed foods. Freedman proposes that the only viable solution is to rely on food giants to solve the problems for the public good. If one calls Freedman’s approach “top-down”, namely that Freedman relies on the food provider to change the status quo, Pollan’s claim is clearly more “bottom-up”. Pollan thinks that we should resort to some rules about what to eat (Pollan 296) so that every food consumers—namely all human beings—are responsible for what they are eating. Despite the fact that Pollan did not discuss at all the practical possibility for such “bottom-up” approach, I believe the following issues are not well-addressed.

It seems that Pollan takes for granted that traditional cuisines are good. As Freedman puts, this is more like a religious belief rather than a serious argument. There is no clear scientific study Pollan draws from. Since eating too much as an ordinary American citizen does is a bad practice, merely being superior to such a practice cannot prove itself good in an absolute sense. Beyond that, one should also note the fact that cuisines are evolved over the last few thousands as human society evolved. What has changed in the last century, however, was so abrupt that one cannot say for sure if our traditional dietary habit did catch up. There might exists issues that were not exposed but are starting to manifest as the average life expectance grows.

While Pollan could refute by saying that my argument relies too much on the idea of a scientifically maximized dietary habit, which is something he tries to avoid at his best (Pollan 301 – 303), I would respond by saying that such a change is inevitable. America is a immigrant country. Each immigrant group brings their own cuisines. However, as Pollan himself points out, these cuisines are eased out and replaced by two dominant approach: the healthy lifestyle in the more affluent class and the unhealthy intake of junk food in the less affluent class. In other words, the traditional dietary rituals that Pollan boasts cannot handle this new environment. One cannot sit there, do nothing, and hope that some omnipotent guy descends and gives American people a new cuisine that survives among these food giants. We are in the middle of a radical change as well as a formation of a new cuisine. Food science has made substantial progress over the last a few decades. We can now identify the main culprits of this obesity epidemic. Food companies can make some real moves to alleviate these problems, maybe solving them completely. It makes no sense, in such a time, to go back to our traditional cuisines. Their very disappearing proves their failure. Plus the fact that food companies and the variety of foods brought by them will not disappear by themselves, it is clear that such a reactionary view cannot persist.

Therefore, I believe that Pollan, though making some good contributions to the conversation, is refuted in a rigors way by Freedman’s essay. His argument is not compelling, and will serve a classic example of a failed argument.
