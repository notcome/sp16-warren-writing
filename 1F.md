# Industrial Agriculture is Sustainable
Is industrialization in the agriculture sector beneficial? Some people have negative answers to this question. In his book _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_, Michael Pollan discusses the dark side of the highly industrialized agriculture in today’s America. In particular, modern agriculture, according to Pollan, is a primary culprit of environmental pollution. He classifies our food production pathways into two types: the industrial way and what he calls “beyond organic.” The industrial agriculture can be further divided into the conventional agriculture and the industrialized organic agriculture. “Beyond organic,” in contrast, is a form of local farming, which manages to create a self-sustainable ecosystem such that the whole system requires nothing but solar energy and leaves no pollution. Pollan argues that we should abandon the industrial agriculture—be it conventional or organic—and switch to “beyond organic.” However, from a practical perspective, there are three issues Pollan fail to consider. First, the pollution caused by conventional agriculture is the fault of the execution, not the technology itself. This environmental issue is treatable and has been mitigated in the past few decades. Second, a large-scale system is inherently more efficient. Therefore, when one considers the lifetime of food products—from farming to processing—and thinks of the planet as a whole, one will find that industrial agriculture is greener than “beyond organic.” Lastly, the expertise required by “beyond organic” limits its potential in being the dominant “food provider.” These three reasons lead to my claim that industrial agriculture is the only practical solution to our food production currently available.

Pollan believes that “beyond organic” is much more friendly to our environment than the industrialized conventional agriculture. As briefly introduced above, in “beyond organic,” farmers maintain a self-sustained ecological cycle. Though theoretically attractive, in practice, “beyond organic” has little advantage over modern conventional agriculture. Pollution from conventional farming is caused by unscientific practices rather than the technology. For example, Pollan talks about how farmers abuse chemical fertilizers to ensure that the soil can grow enough maize. This practice has a severely negative impact on our environment: excess nitrogen will flow off and concentrate in the sea, which has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico (Pollan 46 – 47). Nevertheless, the issue of excess nitrogen is caused by untrained farmers rather than the synthetic fertilizer _per se_. If farmers can measure the nitrogen demand scientifically, they will use the exact amount of fertilizer required. Consequently, there will be no excess nitrogen to cause pollution. In fact, modern conventional agriculture has already been using infrared sensors to measure the amount of nitrogen required, among many other techniques that reduce the “environmental footprint of modern agriculture” (Paarlberg 245). Therefore, it is unnecessary to relinquish the industrialized method during the growing stage for environmental concerns.

Another distinctive feature of “beyond organic” is that its farmers do not process foods as workers of industrial agriculture do. It keeps food fresh not by refrigerator and additives, but by staying local. Pollan gives an interesting example. When he interviewed the “beyond organic” farmer Joel Salatin, the latter pointed out that they refused to ship foods because they were “really serious about energy”; customers would have to “drive down here” to “pick it up” (Pollan 133). In contrast, industrial foods are highly processed to ensure that they are still fresh when customers receive them. The whole process, however, is criticized by Pollan as wasteful. In his description of Earthbound Farm, an industrial organic company that sells ready-to-eat organic salad, Pollan points out that it takes “57 calories of fossil fuel energy for every calorie of food.” A significant amount of energy is “wasted” in the large refrigerator in which workers process vegetables and turn them into salads (Pollan 167). Pollan’s attitude is again articulated in his comparison between the industrial food system—be it conventional farming or “big \[industrial\] organic”—and “beyond organic.” The former is unnatural and wasteful, and it should be replaced by the latter.

From a practical view, however, it’s impossible to realize Pollan’s ideal. To achieve what he asks, we need to change our lavish dietary habits. Instead of eating highly processed foods that are designed to be consumed anywhere, at any time, and in a convenient way, one needs to dedicate a significant amount of time to pick up fresh foods in small local markets and cook these foods in a natural and healthy style. Yet Pollan neglects the time cost imposed by such a lifestyle, which makes the latter impractical. A new lifestyle cannot become mainstream unless it provides enough incentives for the general public. Does Pollan’s proposal have sufficient motivations? Hardly enough. Current studies do not manifest any significant health benefits from eating organic foods (Nestle 75 – 76). Also, pollution caused by food production is a looming issue—after all, it is fish that are dying in the Gulf of Mexico, not _Homo sapiens_. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the majority of us will not give up our dietary habits based on the current arguments presented by Pollan.

Next, we can examine why, with our current lifestyle, industrial agriculture is more energy-saving than “beyond organic.” The key lies in the inherent efficiency brought by large-scale production. Consider the example of food delivery discussed above. If “beyond organic” becomes dominant, each customer will need to drive down to the farm, and the energy spent during this travel is much greater than that required to deliver an equivalent amount of food by a single truck to a local market. “Beyond organic” is by no means energy-friendly. Energy is still spent, albeit invisibly. Moreover, when the yield is large enough, foods can be delivered by trains, like what Americans are doing to industrial corns (Pollan 61). Even cargo ships can be used to transport food across oceans, which enables us to grow foods in more fertile lands and deliver to barren areas, reducing the use of fertilizers, or to deliver to desert regions, decreasing the energy spent on irrigation. Both types of transportation are more efficient than cars in terms of energy consumption. While Pollan blames Earthbound’s large refrigerator, one should not forget that, when the market demands “beyond organic” farms to provide similar ready-to-eat products, these farms will need to build their own small refrigerators. These small refrigerators will consume more energy than a single large refrigerator, or Earthbound would not have built such a giant machine in the first place. Maybe there will be a company dedicated to making such products, owning a giant refrigerator, and collecting materials from “beyond organic” farms, but what then is the advantage “beyond organic” has over its industrial counterpart? When people talk about industrialization, the words “efficiency” and “pollution” often come into mind simultaneously. However, they forget that the very principle that helps reduce monetary costs can also be used to reduce environmental costs. Consequently, only the industrial food system is _practically_ friendly to our environment.

Last but not least, the expertise required for “beyond organic” cannot be reproduced on a large scale, which disqualifies “beyond organic” as a potential food provider. While in conventional agriculture, all the parameters farmers need to know are merely “synthetic fertilizer, chemical pesticides, and the like” (Biello 233), in organic farming, farmers need to maintain an entire ecosystem. As Biello put in his article, organic agriculture is a “knowledge-intensive” sector (Biello 233). The success of capitalism has taught us that it is better to separate the estate—in this case, farms—from technicians, which is exactly what industrial agriculture does. After all, average American farmers are not well-educated in farming—otherwise, they would not abuse synthetic fertilizers in the first place. Besides, if one considers this issue globally, it is unrealistic to educate farmers in most countries—poor African and Asian countries in particular—to go “beyond organic.” In contrast, it is much wiser to let international corporations grow food efficiently. In conclusion, even when organic agriculture’s marginal benefit on environmental protection is a necessity, it is more realistic to employ the industrial model of organic farming.

It is understandable for people to fear new technologies. Pioneers often pay high prices for their courage, sharing the fate of those dead fish in the Gulf of Mexico. However, industrialization in the agricultural sector has matured. The polluting image of conventional agriculture is the past. The advantages brought by large-scale production have outweighed even the most delicate natural system. Moreover, “beyond organic” cannot be reproduced on a large scale to make it a real competitor for the industrial food system. Indeed, there are many issues in American agriculture—like the unfair distribution of economic gains between small farmers and large corporations (Pollan 53)—but we should be pushing legislation to maximize the potential of industrialization rather than moving backward to surrender to nature. The future of sustainable food production should be using high-tech, sustainable, conventional agriculture whenever possible, and when the marginal gain of organic farming is necessary, we should be using _industrial_ organic farming.
